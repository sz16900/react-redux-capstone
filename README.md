In this project, I am going to make a React-Redux simple e-commerce front-end application to demonstrate mastery of building React components by following step-by-step guidelines from a fake company. Awesomized with tailwind.css and Spring. This project is completed by Seth Zea in partial requirements of the Microverse cirriculum.
